# BI-Sales-Performance-Analysis
Business Intelligence project for BM380: Analyzing and reporting on 3-month sales employee performance using KPIs and visualization.
### 🎯 Project Title: 3-Month Sales Performance Analysis and Dashboard Interpretation

### 👤 Group/Student Details
* **Course Code:** BM380
* **Course Title:** Business Intelligence
* **Student Name(s):** [Maryam Israr]
* **Date of Submission:** November 10, 2025

### 💡 Project Objective (CO1 & CO2)
The objective of this project is to apply fundamental Business Intelligence (BI) principles by **analyzing a sales performance dashboard** to derive actionable insights, identify key performance indicators (KPIs), and report on complex business scenarios. This demonstrates the ability to convert raw data visualization into an analytics solution for management.

### 📊 Methodology and Data Overview
* **Data Source:** Internal Sales Performance Data (Employee: Mayank)
* **Time Period:** July - September
* **Tool Used for Visualization:** [Name the tool you used, e.g., Power BI, Tableau, or Cognos]

The analysis focuses on several core KPIs: Leads, Total Sales, Incentive Earned, Efficiency Rate, and Penalties.

### 📈 Key Findings and Business Insights (CO1, CO3, & CO5)
The visualization clearly presents a **volatile performance trend** that requires deeper investigation into the underlying processes.

1.  **High Volume, Low Efficiency Anomaly (The "August Effect"):**
    * August was the peak month for **Leads (109)** and accounted for the majority of **Total Sales (72.54%)** and **Incentive (70.56%)**.
    * Critically, this peak activity coincided with the **lowest Efficiency Rate (0.92%)** and the **highest Penalty incurred** (₹3,864).
    * **Insight:** Mayank is demonstrating the capability to generate high volume, but the process used is highly inefficient and costly, potentially involving non-compliant sales methods or high resource consumption.

2.  **Target Attainment Disconnect:**
    * Despite achieving **₹96,498 in total sales**, the report shows **87 Targets Missed** versus only 5 Targets Achieved.
    * **Insight:** There is a significant disconnect between the sales achieved (revenue) and the specific criteria for a "Target Achieved" (KPI definition). Management must clarify if the sales process is generating low-priority revenue or if the targets themselves are unrealistic.

3.  **Post-Peak Drop-off:**
    * Following the intense August period, **Leads dropped by 25%** in September (from 109 to 81), and the incentive/sales contribution also sharply declined.
    * **Insight:** The high-effort performance in August appears **unsustainable**, leading to immediate drop-off and continued high penalties in September (₹3,674).

### 🚀 Recommendations (CO4 - Advanced Reporting/Actionable Insights)
The following actions are recommended for optimization and future reporting:

1.  **Immediate Process Audit:** Investigate the specific reasons for the **0.92% Efficiency Rate** and the nature of the incurred **Penalties**. These costs are eroding the profitability gained from the high sales volume.
2.  **KPI Refinement:** Redefine the 'Target Achieved' KPI to better align with the strategic goals (e.g., focus on high-margin products or specific customer segments) to prevent the pursuit of high-volume, low-value sales.
3.  **Develop a Sustainable Model:** Use July's **high Efficiency Rate (10.34%)** data as the baseline for a sustainable operational model, integrating the successful lead generation techniques observed in August.
